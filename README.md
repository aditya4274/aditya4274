Hi folks :vulcan_salute:

This is Aditya Jadhav here. I'm a computer engineer by day and a stock trader by night. I'm originally from Bombay (India) and currently based in New Jersey (USA) for my master's program at The Rutgers Business School. I have an extensive and proven experience in sales, ranging from startups to corporates. 
Taking a small detour, I dived into the Product management world which gave me a platform to solve customer problems by implementing new solutions.    

- 👀 I’m interested in solving problems related to product implementation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Business forecasting and Business Intelligence
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on discussions regarding product/program management, business forecasting and business intelligence.

What we are currently working on? :nerd_face:
We are currently working on forecasting the inflation in consumer prices for India and USA by studying data from the past 60 years. This is a key step in understanding the monetary policies which can be implemented by the government.
To measure the accuracy of the forecast, we'll be using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) method.
The data we are using has been collected from the World Bank Organisation.
