Hi folks :vulcan_salute:

This is Aditya Jadhav here. I'm a computer engineer by day and a stock trader by night. I'm originally from Bombay (India) and currently based in New Jersey (USA) for my master's program at The Rutgers Business School. I have an extensive and proven experience in sales, ranging from startups to corporates. 
Taking a small detour, I dived into the Product management world which gave me a platform to solve customer problems by implementing new solutions.    

- 👀 I’m interested in solving problems related to product implementation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Business forecasting and Business Intelligence
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on discussions regarding product/program management, business forecasting and business intelligence.
